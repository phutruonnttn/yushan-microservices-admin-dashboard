# Yushan Microservices Admin Dashboard

> 🛠️ **Admin Dashboard for Yushan Platform (Phase 2 - Microservices)** - Administrative dashboard for the gamified web novel reading platform.

## 📋 Overview

This is the admin dashboard for the microservices architecture of Yushan Platform (Phase 2). This dashboard connects to the API Gateway and communicates with all microservices through the gateway.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Real API integration with JWT tokens and automatic refresh
- **Role-based Access**: Admin-only access with permission management
- **User Management**: Manage readers, writers, and their details
- **Content Management**: Novels, chapters, categories, comments, and reviews
- **Analytics**: Rankings, yuan statistics, and user activity tracking
- **Security**: Token-based authentication with automatic session management

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or higher
- npm or yarn
- Yushan backend API running (default: `http://localhost:8081`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Copy the environment configuration:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
3. Update `.env` with your API base URL if different from default
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Environment Variables

- `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL`: Base URL for the Yushan API (default: `http://localhost:8081/api`)

## Authentication

The admin dashboard integrates with the Yushan UserService authentication API:

- **Login**: `POST /auth/login` - Requires admin privileges
- **Logout**: `POST /auth/logout` - Clears session
- **Refresh**: `POST /auth/refresh` - Automatic token refresh every 15 minutes

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
